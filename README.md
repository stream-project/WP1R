# Performance Comparison of uploading and querying RDF Triples of following repositories: 
           1. GraphDB
           2. RDFox
           3. ALllegroGraph
           4. Virtuoso

In the Experiment folder we have two sub-folders and two files.
           -> File "Queries.txt" has all the queries that are used for comparing time of uploading and querying rdf triples of the above mentioned repositories and the                 file named "comparison of uploading and querying triples" has uploading and querying time comparison of the four used repositories in our work.
