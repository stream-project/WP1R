419,"A customized visible microscope system was used to measure visible absorption between 10,000 and 25,000 cm^{-1}, and a near-IR measurements from 2,000 to 11,000 cm^{-1} were obtained via Bruker Vertex 80v FT-IR spectrometer and a Hyperion-2000 microscope with a MCT detector and CaF2 beamsplitter. Two 50-μm-diameter sample chambers were drilled in a pre-indented tungsten gasket and were filled with (EDBE)CuCl4 and KBr. Reference transmission spectrum was collected using the KBr sample before measuring transmission for (EDBE)CuCl4 using the same conditions. KBr spectra were used to find a basis from which absorbance of (EDBE)CuCl4 was calculated.",810
